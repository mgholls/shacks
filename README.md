Sailing Hacks is simply a demo project to help me learn Python while using my interest in Sailing as the subject matter.
While I am an experienced developer, I am new to Python so forgive my lack of Pythonic knowledge and experience.

## TODO
- Python HTTP client
- Python boilerplate project
- AWS Lambda
